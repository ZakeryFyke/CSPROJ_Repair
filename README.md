# CSPROJ_Repair
A quick work related project that will hopefully help speed up the process of merging different branches by fixing errors that appear within csproj files. 

Currently using the kdif tool to merge large projects can result in errors within the csproj file which can include, but are not limited to, disappearing tags, duplicated tags, and random text insertion. This results in developers wasting valuable work hours attempting to fix these issues. This tool will (hopefully) automate that process.

Disclaimer: While this tool will make a copy of your original csproj file and not alter the original, I still take no responsibility if something gets borked. Back up your stuff.
